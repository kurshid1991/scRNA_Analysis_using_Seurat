## 1. scRNA_Analysis_Guided_Clustering_Tutorial-pbmc3k
For this tutorial, we will be analyzing the a dataset of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) freely available from 10X Genomics. There are 2,700 single cells that were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500.

The **dataset** for this tutorial can be downloaded from here:
https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz

ðŸ“Š **Seurat Object Structure**
The tutorial is built around the Seurat object, which serves as a central container for:

- Raw & normalized data

- Cell-level metadata

- Dimensionality reductions (PCA, UMAP, etc.)

- Clustering results

- Graph-based structures (kNN, SNN)

## 2. Data visualization

**Title:**  
ðŸ§¬ **Visualizing Single-Cell Data in Seurat: A Comprehensive Guide**

**Summary:**  
This Seurat visualization vignette demonstrates how to effectively explore and present single-cell RNA-seq data using the Seurat R package. It covers key plotting functions such as `DimPlot`, `FeaturePlot`, `VlnPlot`, `RidgePlot`, `DotPlot`, and `Heatmap`, providing insight into cell clustering, gene expression, and cell identity.

The tutorial showcases how to visualize dimensionality reductions (UMAP/tSNE), display feature-level expression across cells, and create comparative plots across conditions or metadata groups.

The guide emphasizes clarity, aesthetics, and the power of patchwork for combining multiple plots into cohesive figuresâ€”making it essential for publication-quality visual analytics in scRNA-seq research.
